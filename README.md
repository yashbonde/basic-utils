# basic-utils

These are some basic files that I keep using in various models. For example the text folder contains a helper file which parses the data to be fed into an RNN.

# Simple Models
This repository also has some files which I keep coming back to for reference, such as simple implementations of convolutional models.

## Auto Encoders
The folder autoencoders is has some simple implementations of autoencoders like denoising, compression, etc.
